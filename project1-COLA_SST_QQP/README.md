In this project, we attempted to solve the following problems:

1. The Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) which consists of identifying if a sentence is positive or not. 
2. The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (COLA) wher we have to tell if a sentence is acceptable or not.
3. The Quora Question Pairs (QQP) which consists on identifying if two questions have the same meaning or not.
